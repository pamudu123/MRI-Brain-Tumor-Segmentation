Try to build the code and Deep Learning model following the paper.

When you are doing edits maintain a MD files for explain what you are doing for the user.
There you have to explain the logics to user

Use a single consolidated doc: see `docs/implementation_log.md` for all decisions, logic, and progress.

Segmentation experiment for "[Pamudu Ranasinghe] MRI Brain Tumor Localization and Segmentation" is under `paper_implementation/segmentation/`. See `docs/implementation_log.md` for details.
Update: segmentation code moved to `experiments/` (runner: `experiments/runner.py`).

Follow unified structure for all the codes
